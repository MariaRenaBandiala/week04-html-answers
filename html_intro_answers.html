    <h2>My Personal Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Reading <em>Bridge to Terabithia</em> was an emotional rollercoaster. At first, I loved how Jesse and Leslie created their own magical world, showing the power of imagination and friendship. But as the story unfolded, it hit me hard especially in the part of Leslie’s tragic fate. It was heartbreaking, yet it also taught me how important it is to cherish the people we love. This book isn’t just a story; it’s a reminder of how friendships shape us and how we can find strength even in loss. It’s a book that stays with you long after you’ve turned the last page. In summary Naiyak po talaga ako Hahaahahha.</p>
